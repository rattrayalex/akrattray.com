# AKRattray.com, the customizable online home of Anna Kate!

Dear Anna Kate, 

Happy (early) Birthday! 

You have another gift coming too, but I was too excited about this one to let it wait. It's your own website that you can edit to your heart's content! 

All you have to do is [create a Github account](https://github.com/join), tell me your username so I can add you as an admin, [click `"index.html"`](https://github.com/rattrayalex/akrattray.com/edit/gh-pages/index.html) here on [this webpage](https://www.github.com/rattrayalex/akrattray.com), and then "Edit" (it's the pencil icon in the top right). 

I hope it's a fun way for you to learn some HTML and maybe even some CSS! Mom knows a little and she can help you; maybe Zach can jump in too! Dad can be a cheerleader (he still has those pom-pom's, right?). Maybe it'll also get you to call up yer ol' brother Alex on the Skype one of these days, too...

(Note: I included [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) so you can use their CSS to build off of in case that's easier. You can wait on that part though.)

Hope you enjoy!

Love, 

Alex
